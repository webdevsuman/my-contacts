This is a basic form fillup page, where you can store anybody's name, phone number into your Local Storage and See the saved Contacts.

Technologies used - 
1. HTML
2. JavaScript with DOM manipulation
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Local Storage for saving the data

Things I learned new through this - 
1. Tailwind CSS classes
2. Local Storage methods
3. Injecting JSON into an array to Local storage and Retrieving from it and Updating it after deleting a specific user(object).
4. Refreshing the webpage through Javascript inbuilt function.
5. Basic form validation before storing it to the local storage.
